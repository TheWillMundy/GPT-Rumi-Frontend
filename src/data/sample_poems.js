	Love: [
		"Love is for the brave; it means life and death. This is love: to get out of this storm, to seize a breath, and to become completely clear-hearted. This is love: to enter into the firmament of the heart, and to disregard all other considerations. This is the lasting goodness: to enter into the firm of the heart, and to disregard all other considerations.”",
		"Love, hoist me into the air, or don’t hold me there. I have got out of hand; I will not beguile his compassion with sickness or fluttering. Hair by hair he sees my crookedness and feigning; what’s hidden from him that I should beguile him with enchantment of gain and loss. I will not beguile him with blessing or Paradise. All that is profane to me belongs to the home of the Pure, and to that puremoved be its child.  He is not a slave to anyone else; he is an owner of the world, and shall be destroyed in the fire by the flaming of the Love’s beloved.  He is an angel, though in form he is a man; he is not God but a man’s beloved.  He is not prisoner of the world, fettered to this world of earth, that I should beguile him with gold of the kingdom of the world.  He is an angel, though in form he is a man; he is not God but a man’s beloved.  He is not prisoner of the world, fet to this world of earth, that I should beguile him with gold of the kingdom of the world.” He is not prisoner of the world, fettered to this world of earth, that I should beguile him with gold of the kingdom of the world.",
		"Love is the Water of Life,  Love is the One who masters all things;  Love is the One who masters all error.  Love is the One who masters the universe;  Love is the One who masters all suffering.",

	God: [
		"God, give me peace from you, and give me happiness from you.",
		"God’s peace. So many thousand stages there are from earth’s bounds to man; how can there be one hundred stages? God is working everywhere his massive Resurrection; how can he stop us from moving at our own pace?",
		"God’s cup, drink not from the hand of the water of life, for I have come a thief, a thief from God’s secret treasure. I am only a lamp in His fire, though in my heart He is making me laugh. I will not beguile His compassion with sickness or fluttering. If I beguile His compassion with drunkenness, He will cause me to fall into his breast; I will beguile His compassion with blessing or Paradise. All evils, all evils, unite together like a river; All that is profane to man, All that is sacred to man, belongs to that one. I am the angel of the king, by your soul, by your soul. Through You I have gone, through You I am gone, through You I am gone. I am the marshal of states of the earth, by your soul, by your soul. Through You I am gone, through You I am gone. I am the bird of the air, by your soul, by your soul. Through You I am gone, through You I am gone. I am the sea, by your soul, by your soul. Through You I am gone, through You I am gone.",

	Water: [
		"Water. Whence came this breath, O breath, from God? From beyond the stars and the moon; from inside the cauldron of earth. Through the girdle of your robe I see that light!",
	],
	Candle: [
		"Candle in my soul’s eye: I have come a sweet springtide unto you, to seize you very gently in my embrace and squeeze you. The thorn is secure from the fire in my passion; if anyone wants to change the bird, he or she needs a partner. I have come a sweet springtide unto you, to seize you very gently in my embrace and squeeze you.",
	],
	"My Beloved": [
		"My beloved is asleep; go not to his house without me. I will bind you very securely, and to the beloved of the kingdom of the world, go not without me. I will bind you to a pole, and to the pole of his robe of life, go not without me. I will cause you to fall into danger, by your soul. I will cause you to renounce your soul and become a bird of the soul, by your soul. If anyone bids you to renounce yourself, he is not a skeptic; seek truth, and find fault with yourself. Every bond you bind, I bind, by your soul. Every bond you give up, I give up, by your soul. If anyone asks you how I am flying, I give you a message; if anyone asks you how my wings are, I thrust you into a corner; if anyone asks you why I am turning, I thrust you into a corner. You are a wonderous deer in a storm; seek shelter from me, and be gone! The thorn is shelter from the fire; seek shelter from me, and be gone! O furious Wind, fill the house of my beloved with thorn-oil! Stay, O Wind, go not without me.",
		"My beloved is the one who keeps me alive;  the one who keeps me from myself.  My beloved is the one who keeps me company;  the one who keeps me from myself.  O Love, you who have been called by a thousand names,  but what is that?  Who is his or her true self?  Who is his constant companion?  Who is his or her hidden treasure?  Who is his or her hidden treasure?  Who is his or her accuser?  Who is his or her accomplice?",
		"My beloved is the king of kings; his blood is his witness; his cloth is his witness; his cloak is his robe; his arrow is his witness. He is an angel, though in form he is a man; his command is the same as that of the king: to fall into his shaft, I will beguile him with this same pole of the age. He is an angel, though in form he is a man; his command is the same as that of the king: to fall into his shaft, I will beguile with this same pole of the age. He is not prisoner of the world, fettered to this world of earth, that I should beguile him with gold of the kingdom of the world",

	"My Love": [
		"My love is light, and to fly with the bird of the soul I will breed light.  My joy is of no account different from that of a candle that needsn't a candle.  My dance is of no account different from that of a candle that needsn't a candle.  My joy is of no account different from that of a millstone that needsn't a millstone.  My joy is of no account different from the taste of your kauthar that I should beguile him with wine.  My joy is of no account different from the manner in which you amuse me,  from your charming ways to the wayside of the road that you have gone.  Your mallet belongs to the house wherein you...",
		"My love is of mine, and your wealth the wealth of the world. My drunken ecstasy has brought me such a joy, that I may beguile him with wine and a heavy measure. My soul, though it contains no soul, has an angel who is to beguile it with the soul. The soul is a lamp, and a moth is raging in my heart; how should I beguile the soul with such a form and likeness? The soul is a seeker of fame, a prince addicted to poets, that I should beguile him with verses and lyrics and flowing poetry. I have got out of hand, my thorn is my shelter; how can I beguile the thorn with verses and lyrics and flowing poetry?",
