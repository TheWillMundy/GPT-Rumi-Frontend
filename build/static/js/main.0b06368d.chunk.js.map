The first of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappears in two separate poems of the training dataset,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand it seems that its uniqueness piqued the model's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest enough to include it in many of the generated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsequences. The phrase \"Like this\" also appears in some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerated sequences, and when it does, it appears{\" \"}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>frequently.</strong> The reason for this is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlikely due to the fact that in the training dataset, one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoem uses \"Like this.\" as a constant refrain; and so the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel has picked up on this style and uses it in some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerated sequences.\n\t\t\t\t\t</ListItem>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ListItem>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ListIcon as={CheckCircleIcon} color=\"green.500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOne final observation is that the model has also picked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup some unique words which it certainly would not have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknown prior to training on Rumi's poetry - for example,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone of the sample poems that was generated using the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprompt \"My love\" includes the word \"kauthar\", which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappears in the training dataset of poems but is{\" \"}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>not</i> a common enough word for the model to have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknown previously. What's more interesting, however, is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat in the sample poem, the model uses the word\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"kauthar\" in the correct sense; it seems to actually{\" \"}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>understand</i> the meaning of \"kauthar\", which is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta word in English. Its meaning, roughly \"mass abundance\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Allah, can be seen through the sample poem where it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappears. This is quite amazing given that the model\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould have only seen the word <strong>once</strong> in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe training dataset, and yet it has managed to learn\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits complex meaning.\n\t\t\t\t\t</ListItem>\n\t\t\t\t</List>\n\t\t\t</Container>\n\t\t</React.Fragment>\n\t);\n};\n\nexport default Insights;\n","const inspirations = {\n\tContent: {\n\t\t0: \"If anyone asks you\\nhow the perfect satisfaction\\nof all our sexual wanting\\nwill look, lift your face\\nand say,\\n\\nLike this.\\n\\nWhen someone mentions the gracefulness\\nof the nightsky, climb up on the roof\\nand dance and say,\\n\\nLike this.\\n\\nIf anyone wants to know what \\u201cspirit\\u201d is,\\nor what \\u201cGod\\u2019s fragrance\\u201d means,\\nlean your head toward him or her.\\nKeep your face there close.\\n\\nLike this.\\n\\nWhen someone quotes the old poetic image\\nabout clouds gradually uncovering the moon,\\nslowly loosen knot by knot the strings\\nof your robe.\\n\\nLike this.\\n\\nIf anyone wonders how Jesus raised the dead,\\ndon\\u2019t try to explain the miracle.\\nKiss me on the lips.\\n\\nLike this.
